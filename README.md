# ANZ Virtual Experience by Forage.

Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, GeoPandas, Scikit-learn.

## Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis.

Used Pandas to segregate customer data based on their account number, by each month. Matplotlib to visualise transaction volumes and mean transaction amount/day. Visualised average customer balance and average payment by age, for each month in the data set.

## Task 2: Predictive Analytics.

Pandas was used to evaluate the annual customer salary based on their unique account_id and mean. Scikit-learn was used for machine learning algorithms. Important features like point of sale, average payment, age were selected and they were used to create a linear regression model, decision tree and k-means clustering for customer segmentation.
