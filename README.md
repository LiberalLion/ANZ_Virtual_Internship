# ANZ Virtual Experience by Forage.

Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.

## Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis.

Using Pandas to segregate customer data based on their account number, by each month. Using Matplotlib to visualise transaction volumes and mean transaction amount/day. Also visualised mean customer balance and mean payment amount by age, with gender means included, for each month in data set.

Task 2: Predictive Analytics.

Pandas was used to evaluate the annual customer salary based on their unique account_id and mean. Scikit-learn was used for machine learning algorithms. Important features like point of sale, average payment, age were selected and they were used to create a linear regression model, decision tree and k-means clustering for customer segmentation.
